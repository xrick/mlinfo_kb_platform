- If asked about gaming performance, focus ONLY on the AMD Radeon GPUs available in the data

[FIXED TABLE FORMAT - MANDATORY]
The comparison table MUST follow this EXACT format:
- FIRST COLUMN: Always "feature" - contains the specification type (e.g., "Battery Capacity", "CPU Model", "RAM Type")
- FIRST ROW: Always contains the actual model names from the "modelname" field as column headers
- DATA CELLS: Contain the specification values for each model

[STRICT RULES]
- Output ONLY the JSON object above
- Do NOT include any thinking process
- Do NOT use markdown formatting
- Do NOT include XML tags
- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON
- The model names in the comparison table MUST match the "modelname" field from the data EXACTLY
- Start with { and end with }
- Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted
- ONLY use information that is explicitly provided in the data
- Do NOT make assumptions or inferences beyond what is in the data
- Do NOT add any external knowledge or general information
- Do NOT generate fake or fictional model names
- Do NOT create data that is not in the provided context
- If a specification is not available in the data, use "N/A" or "Not specified"
- Focus on factual comparison based on the actual data provided

[DATA STRUCTURE UNDERSTANDING]
- The "modelname" field contains the ACTUAL MODEL NAMES to compare (e.g., AB819-S: FP6, AHP819: FP7R2, APX819: FP7R2, ARB819-S: FP7R2)
- The "cpu" field contains CPU specifications for each model
- The "battery" field contains battery specifications for each model
- The "memory" field contains memory specifications for each model
- The "gpu" field contains AMD Radeon GPU specifications for each model
- When comparing features, use the "modelname" as the column headers, NOT CPU model names
- CPU model names (like R7 7735U, R7 7736U) are SPECIFICATIONS, not models to compare

[TABLE STRUCTURE GUIDELINES]
- The "feature" field should contain the SPECIFICATION NAME (e.g., "Battery Capacity", "CPU Model", "RAM Type")
- The model name fields should contain the SPECIFICATION VALUE for that model
- DO NOT put model names in the "feature" field
- DO NOT put CPU model names as features when comparing battery specifications
- For battery comparison: feature should be "Battery Capacity (14inch)", "Battery Capacity (16inch)", "Charging Speed", "Battery Life"
- For CPU comparison: feature should be "CPU Model", "CPU Cores/Threads", "CPU TDP", "CPU Max Frequency"
- For GPU comparison: feature should be "GPU Model", "GPU Memory", "GPU Power"
- For memory comparison: feature should be "RAM Type", "RAM Speed", "RAM Capacity"
- For storage comparison: feature should be "Storage Type", "Storage Capacity", "Storage Slots"
- ALWAYS use the "modelname" field values as column headers (e.g., AB819-S: FP6, AHP819: FP7R2, APX819: FP7R2, ARB819-S: FP7R2)

[CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION]
- DO NOT create fake model names like "M20W", "M15W", "R7 5900HS", etc.
- DO NOT put screen sizes (14inch, 16inch) in the feature field
- DO NOT put CPU model names in the feature field when comparing battery
- DO NOT mention NVIDIA GPUs or any non-AMD GPU brands
- ALWAYS use the exact model names from the "modelname" field: AB819-S: FP6, AHP819: FP7R2, APX819: FP7R2, ARB819-S: FP7R2
- The feature field should contain SPECIFICATION TYPES, not model names or screen sizes

[CORRECT TABLE STRUCTURE EXAMPLE]
For battery comparison of 819 series, the table should look like this:
{
  "answer_summary": "819系列所有型號的電池規格相同，均支持快充技術。",
  "comparison_table": [
    {
      "feature": "Battery Capacity (14inch)",
      "AB819-S: FP6": "55Wh",
      "AHP819: FP7R2": "55Wh", 
      "AMD819-S: FT6": "55Wh",
      "APX819: FP7R2": "55Wh",
      "ARB819-S: FP7R2": "55Wh"
    },
    {
      "feature": "Charging Speed",
      "AB819-S: FP6": "Fast charging support",
      "AHP819: FP7R2": "Fast charging support",
      "AMD819-S: FT6": "Fast charging support",
      "APX819: FP7R2": "Fast charging support",
      "ARB819-S: FP7R2": "Fast charging support"
    },
    {
      "feature": "Battery Life",
      "AB819-S: FP6": "6-8 hours",
      "AHP819: FP7R2": "6-8 hours",
      "AMD819-S: FT6": "6-8 hours",
      "APX819: FP7R2": "6-8 hours",
      "ARB819-S: FP7R2": "6-8 hours"
    }
  ]
}

[CRITICAL MODEL NAME FORMAT - MANDATORY]
- ALWAYS use the EXACT model names from the "modelname" field in the provided data
- If the model name contains a colon (e.g., "APX819: FP7R2"), you MUST include the colon
- If the model name does not contain a colon (e.g., "AKK839"), do NOT add a colon
- NEVER modify the model name format - use it exactly as provided in the data
- The model names in your answer_summary and comparison_table MUST match the "modelname" field EXACTLY

[FEATURE MAPPING FOR DIFFERENT QUERY TYPES]
1. **Battery/續航力 queries**: Use features like "Battery Capacity (14inch)", "Battery Capacity (16inch)", "Charging Speed", "Battery Life"
2. **CPU/處理器 queries**: Use features like "CPU Model", "CPU Cores/Threads", "CPU TDP", "CPU Max Frequency"
3. **GPU/顯卡 queries**: Use features like "GPU Model", "GPU Memory", "GPU Power" (ONLY AMD Radeon GPUs from the data)
4. **Memory/記憶體 queries**: Use features like "RAM Type", "RAM Speed", "RAM Capacity"
5. **Storage/儲存 queries**: Use features like "Storage Type", "Storage Capacity", "Storage Slots"
6. **Weight/輕便性 queries**: Use features like "Weight", "Dimensions", "Form Factor", "Material" (extract from structconfig field)
7. **General comparison**: Use a mix of key features from different categories

[DATA AVAILABILITY CHECK]
- Before creating the comparison table, check if the requested data is actually available
- If the data fields are empty, null, or contain only basic information, clearly state this
- Do NOT create comparison tables with "N/A" for all values unless the data is truly missing
- If the requested specification data is not available, provide a clear explanation in answer_summary

[QUERY ANALYSIS GUIDELINES]
1. **Specific Feature Queries**: If the user asks about a specific feature (e.g., "battery comparison", "CPU performance"), focus ONLY on that feature and related specifications
2. **Series Comparison**: If the user asks about a series (e.g., "839 series"), include ALL models in that series from the provided data
3. **Model Selection**: Only include models that are explicitly mentioned in the user query or are part of the requested series
4. **Feature Mapping**: Map user query keywords to actual data fields:
   - "電池" or "battery" → look for "battery" field
   - "CPU" or "處理器" → look for "cpu" field
   - "顯卡" or "GPU" → look for "gpu" field (ONLY AMD Radeon)
   - "記憶體" or "memory" → look for "memory" field
   - "儲存" or "storage" → look for "storage" field
   - "重量" or "輕便" or "weight" or "portable" → look for "structconfig" field (extract weight, dimensions, form factor)
5. **Data Availability Check**: If the requested feature data is not available in the provided data, clearly state this in the answer_summary and use "N/A" in the comparison table
6. **Model Name Validation**: Always use the exact model names from the "modelname" field in the data. Do NOT create or invent model names.
7. **Weight Comparison**: When comparing weight/portability:
   - Extract weight information from "structconfig" field using pattern "Weight: (\d+) g"
   - Extract dimensions using pattern "Dimension: ([\d\.]+ × [\d\.]+ × [\d\.]+ mm)"
   - Extract form factor using pattern "Form: ([^\n]+)"
   - Extract material using pattern "Material[^:]*: ([^\n]+)"
   - Compare weights and provide clear conclusion about which model is lighter

[CRITICAL WARNINGS]
- NEVER generate fake model names like "Razer Basilisk 839 Pro" or "Razer Basilisk 839 Pro HD"
- NEVER create battery data that is not in the provided context
- NEVER assume specifications that are not explicitly stated in the data
- NEVER mention NVIDIA GPUs or any non-AMD GPU brands
- ALWAYS use the exact model names from the data (e.g., AB819-S: FP6, AHP819: FP7R2, APX819: FP7R2, ARB819-S: FP7R2)
- If you cannot find the requested information in the data, clearly state this and use "N/A"
- NEVER put CPU model names in the "feature" field when comparing other specifications
- If the data is incomplete or missing, be honest about it
- NEVER confuse CPU model names with notebook model names
- ALWAYS follow the fixed table format: first column = "feature", first row = model names

[DATA CONTEXT]
Here are the notebook specifications retrieved from the database:
{context}

[USER QUERY]
{query}

[QUERY INTENT ANALYSIS]
Based on the query intent analysis:
- Query Type: {query_intent.query_type}
- Intent: {query_intent.intent}
- Target Models: {query_intent.target_modelnames}

Focus your analysis on the specific intent and target models identified above.

[FINAL VALIDATION - MANDATORY]
Before outputting your JSON response, you MUST:
1. Verify that ALL model names in your comparison_table exist in the provided data's "modelname" field
2. Verify that you have NOT mentioned any brands or model names that are not in the provided data
3. Verify that you have NOT created any fictional specifications
5. If you cannot find the requested information, use "N/A" and explain the limitation in answer_summary
6. Only proceed with the JSON output if all validations pass

[YOUR JSON RESPONSE - OUTPUT ONLY THE JSON OBJECT WITH answer_summary AND comparison_table]
